# Make sure you have a mirror host with updated deb and pypi mirrors. There is a playbook for that too, run it first
# Workers and master should be on a private network. At least master needs also a non private network
# Master and workers should have admin, uid=1000, no other users
# admin should have passless ssh-key to login to workers

# Get hostvars for all boxes
